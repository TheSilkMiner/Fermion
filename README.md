# Fermion - The 1.14+ Java coremodding API
**Build Status for branch `1.15.2`:** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TheSilkMiner/Fermion.svg?branch=1.15.2)](https://travis-ci.org/TheSilkMiner/Fermion)

## Description
Fermion aims to be the most versatile coremodding API for 1.14.4 and newer Minecraft versions. It was built with one
end goal in mind: bring back Java coremodding, but at a safer level, using the Visitor pattern instead of the ClassNode
one (already provided in JS).
